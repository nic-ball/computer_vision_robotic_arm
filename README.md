# Computer Vision Robotic Arm

A project to design, 3D print and code a robotic arm that can be controlled remotely and also uses computer vision.

## 3D Model

- For initial start-up speed I've chosen to use a design from [@mobiobi](https://www.printables.com/@mobiobi) on [Printables](https://www.printables.com/model/97370-easy-robot-arm-sg90-servos-now-steppers-too-update).
- I redesigned the **Stepper Plate** so the **28BYJ-48 Stepper Motor** fit correctly (I've added the design to the 3D Print folder).


## TODO

- [ ] Code Stepper Motor
- [ ] Code Servo Motors
- [ ] Research Computer Vision
- [ ] Code Computer Vision
- [ ] Code Remote Control
- [ ] Code Robotic Arm
- [ ] Test Robotic Arm
